# **Traffic Sign Classifier**
[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)

This repository contains my implementation of the homonymous open source [project](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Traffic-Sign-Classifier-Project/blob/master/writeup_template.md) part of the [Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](http://www.udacity.com/drive).

For a step by step walkthrough of the project and an overview of the theory used see [here](https://iacopomc.github.io/projects/2020-07-25-traffic-sign-classifier-project/) and [here](https://iacopomc.github.io/blog/traffic-sign-classifier/)

The file `signnames.csv` contains "id to name" mappings for each id.
